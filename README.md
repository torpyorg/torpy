=====

A pure python Tor client implementation of the Tor protocol.
Torpy can be used to communicate with clearnet hosts or hidden services through the [Tor Network](https://torproject.org/about/overview.html).

**Features**
- No Stem or official Tor client required
- Support v2 hidden services ([v2 specification](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/rend-spec-v2.txt))
- Support *Basic* and *Stealth* authorization protocol
- Provide simple [TorHttpAdapter](https://github.com/torpyorg/torpy/blob/master/torpy/http/adapter.py) for [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) library
- Provide simple urllib [tor_opener](https://github.com/torpyorg/torpy/blob/master/torpy/http/urlopener.py) for making requests without any dependencies
- Provide simple Socks5 proxy

Console examples
-----------
There are several console utilities to test the client.

A simple HTTP/HTTPS request:
```bash

Usage examples 
-----------

A basic example of how to send some data to a clearnet host or a hidden service:
```python
from torpy import TorClient

hostname = 'ifconfig.me'  # It's possible use onion hostname here as well
with TorClient() as tor:
    # Choose random guard node and create 3-hops circuit
    with tor.create_circuit(3, exit_country='FR') as circuit:
        # Create tor stream to host
        with circuit.create_stream((hostname, 80)) as stream:
            # Now we can communicate with host
            stream.send(b'GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: %s\r\n\r\n' % hostname.encode())
            recv = stream.recv(1024)
```

The `exit_country` behaviour isn't available out-of-the-box, but can be enabled via `pip install torpy[exit_country]`.


TorHttpAdapter is a convenient Tor adapter for the [requests library](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#transport-adapters).
The following example shows the usage of TorHttpAdapter for multi-threaded HTTP requests:
```python
from multiprocessing.pool import ThreadPool
from torpy.http.requests import tor_requests_session

with tor_requests_session() as s:  # returns requests.Session() object
    links = ['http://nzxj65x32vh2fkhk.onion', 'http://facebookcorewwwi.onion'] * 2

    with ThreadPool(3) as pool:
        pool.map(s.get, links)

```

For more examples see [test_integration.py](https://github.com/torpyorg/torpy/blob/master/tests/integration/test_integration.py)


Installation
------------
* Just `pip3 install torpy`
* Or for using TorHttpAdapter with requests library you need install extras:
`pip3 install torpy[requests]`
